**My role:** Co-founder, Head of Product, and interim CEO

Our mission was to make it easier for subprime customers to buy and finance cars online. </br>

The core problem to solve was that itâ€™s difficult to match a customer who has a "non-prime" financial background with a vehicle and lender combination that satisfies the needs of all parties. This is increasing difficult in person as single dealerships have limited inventory and lender relationships, causing the customer to get rejected and waste time going dealership to dealership.

We sought to solve this problem by creating an online experience that focused on matching the customer to only vehicles with high likelihood for approval and fueling these matches with a broad network of vehicles and lenders, then finally by delivering the vehicle directly to the customer. Together, we would create a shopping experience that would save time and improve the approval odds of those in this underserved market.

We scaled the company to 22 employees and $XXm in yearly revenue with 4.5+ stars on both FB and Google. We operated the company for ~30 months before winding it down.
